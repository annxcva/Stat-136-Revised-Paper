## Summary
This paper explores gentrification dynamics in the Philippines using provincial socioeconomic and development indicators. Income inequality, measured through the Palma Ratio, was modeled via multiple linear regression with data from 71 provinces. After variable transformations and selection, the final model explained about 59% of the variation, highlighting poverty incidence, unemployment, underemployment, domestic tourism, and sectoral GDP growth (manufacturing, construction, and transport) as key predictors. While limited by data availability, the study gives a starting point for understanding gentrification and inequality in the Philippine setting.
